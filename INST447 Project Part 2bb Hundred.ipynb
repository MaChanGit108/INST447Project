      " Overall 5 Story 3 Animation 7 Sound 7 Character 5 Enjoyment 5 \"They call it Hundred because you've seen this show hundreds of times already.\" I don't remember the name of the original user who said this but I do like that part in your review. If I had to say what Hundred's weakness is, its that the show lacks any uniqueness to help it stand out more from the rest of the magic school battle anime out there. It appears as if there is a really bad cycle in Japan right now where so many.. school/harem/sci-fi anime are taking over and in my opinion not too many of them are doing so well. I mean we've had asterisk wars, chivalry of a failed knight and many more similar every season and each title just leaves me with mixed feelings. Now the story is simple, straight-forward yet lacks uniqueness which I believe is something that is absolutely vital in every anime & manga. Hundred is literally copy & pasted meaning if you have watched at least 2 or three titles similar to this then you can already predict the upcoming events and the relationships between characters. In addition to that, prediction the plot along with the events that are going to take place for certain episodes is sort of like a walk in the park. Now I'm not really trying to criticize Jun Misaki because other authors obviously have this idea too. They want use the re-occurring themes found in other authors work and make their own unique novel based upon those theme. That's perfectly fine however it hurts both the story and the plot in many ways because it is all too common. This is exactly why I brought up the \"bad cycle\" theory. If I didn't watch shows like these when they aired for a while and just got into hundred then perhaps I could've felt that the story was refreshing however, this simply was not the case. There were no exciting story developments and plot development felt weak. Most importantly though it was pretty hard for me to get excited and engaged with such meritocracy. Overall I just was not impressed with the stories presentation nor plot because it's been done too many times to the point where I really wanted to drop it. The art & animation is actually really great. The flow of the fighting and action scenes were amazing to me. Although I could've done without the talking through most of the battles, I was, for the most part impressed seeing the duels between characters like Claire, Hayato, Emile etc. The character designs were pretty good however I still prefer the illustrations done in the light novel by Nekosuke Ōkuma over designs made by the producers at Production IMS. Sound was pretty decent for the most part. I didn't care for the soundtracks background music nor the opening and intro songs. I did like the sound effects I think those were pretty good. The singing done in the show , sort of like pre-game musical performances were annoying. It's like they tried to add Idols to the already unnecessarily convoluted show. I don't really have too much to say about the seiyuu's involved in the show. I think their performances were pretty good. They each delivered some pretty solid lines. Overall I was okay with the sound department not too many complaints nor praise to give it. Characters are so forgettable that I'll probably never even remember them. Hayato Kisaragi is literally copy and pasted from every other show liked this. the childhood friend romance is overplayed. The girls start to fall for generic MC kun. Fan service, fan service, Production IMS should have at least taken the time to make the fan service look good. I would love to delve more into the characters department however, because I've finished my review, I probably don't want to go back watch the show again and then edit my review again to add more details. This is simply because I feel like my review based on the characters would be more like a rant rather than an actual review. My impressions of the characters overall is that they simply needed more work to distinguish themselves from others. My enjoyment for the series pretty low. I felt like this was a title I really should have dropped however, my goal is to see every show through regardless of how \"bad\" or \"Awful\" it is. Personally I do feel like if this show didn't rely mostly on overused plot, story and characters found in similar titles then it really could have been better. compared to chivalry of a failed knight I liked it better because even though the titles shared somewhat similar stories, failed knight, even asterisk wars, remained unique, had likable characters, and a better story introduction along with finishes. I felt like there was a lack of effort put into the creation of the Hundred anime. It was sort of like the director said \"alright team, we are producing a new show, go watch every show with similar story, plot, and characters and copy it asap.\" However! However, they forgot about crucial part \"making hundred unique.\" If I asked anyone whose scene this show \"Hey do you remember hundred\" I am roughly 92.5% sure they wouldn't remember it. Hundred fails to leave me with a memorable impression of it. Overall I wouldn't recommend hundred to anyone. I feel like there is too many imperfections to this series. Hundred is about 70% avoidable, I'd say there is a one in a \"Hundred\" chance of me watching this again.. I wanted to walk a Hundred miles away from my computer while watching this... okay, that last one didn't work but you get the point.. I didn't like hundred.. Helpful read more \n"
